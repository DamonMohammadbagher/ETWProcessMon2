# ETWProcessMon2 `(v2.1)`
ETWProcessMon2 (ver2) is for Monitoring Process/Thread/Memory/Imageloads/TCPIP via ETW + Detection for Remote-Thread-Injection & Payload Detection by VirtualMemAlloc Events (in-memory) etc.

Note: `ETWProcessMon2.1 (v2.1) is new version of code, in this new version VirtualMemAlloc Events removed from source code & now Code Performance is very fast/good (this version ETWProcessMon2.1 will work with ETWPM2Monitor2 v2.1 very good for Technique/Payload Detection via ETW Events)`

Note: `if your "Windows Defender Anti-virus" have/had problem with ETWPM2Monitor2.exe you should Disable AV to use this Tool (Real-time should be off also Tamper Protection should be off, ...)`, Sometimes ETWPM2Monitor2.exe crashed by AVs so you should test these tools (ETWPM2Monitor2.1 , SysPM2Monitor2.7) in windows without Antivirus (Disabled AV)

### ETWProcessMon2.exe
"ETWProcessMon" is simple tool for Monitor Processes/Threads/Memory/Imageloads/TCPIP Events via ETW, with this code you can Monitor New Processes also you can See New Threads (Thread Started event) + Technique Detection for Remote-Thread-Injection (Which Means Your New Thread Created into Target Process by Another Process), also with this code you can Monitor VirtualMemAllocation Events in Memory for All Processes (which sometimes is very useful for Payload Detection in-memory) also you can see ImageLoads for each Process & you can see TCPIP Send Events for each Process too. 

simple examples for using [output.txt information] which made by ETWProcessMon2.1 to detect Dll loads after RemoteThreadInjection Attack into Mspaint Process via `Sliver-C2` Http/s Beacons

 ### ETWProcessMon2.exe v2.1 for Dll Loads Detection via DLL Loads ETW Events....

   ![](https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/blob/main/Pics/ETW1_Sliver_http_stagelistener_2.png)   

in these second examples you can see how we can use ETWProcessMon/2 v1/v1.1 or v2.1 for Payload Detection or Beacon Detection via Abnormal ETW VirtualMemAlloc Events & Thread Start Events .
 ### ETWProcessMon.exe v1.0/v1.1/v2.0 vs ETWProcessMon2.exe v2.1 for Beacon Detection via VirtualMemAlloc ETW Events....  
   ![](https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/blob/main/Pics/BeaconDetection1.png)
   
 ### ETWProcessMon.exe v1.0/v1.1/v2.0 vs ETWProcessMon2.exe v2.1 for Beacon Detection via VirtualMemAlloc ETW Events....  
   ![](https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/blob/main/Pics/BeaconDetection2.png)

also in the next picture you can see what we can find in "ETWProcessMonlog.txt" file which made by ETWProcessMon v1.0 , v1.1 and v2.0 , but in ETWProcessMon2.exe v2.1 we don't have this text log file, for example you can see in Cobaltstrike v4.4 with Sleep Command (which will Encrypt/Decrypt MZ Header in-memory)
you will have Abnormal ETW VirtualMemAlloc Events for Target Process in this case "Notepad", as you can see when Sleep set to 2 then we have every 2 sec ETW VirtualMemAlloc Events for same StartAddress (in-memory) for Process Notepad. (Delta time for Each ETW event is 2 sec because Sleep Set to 2 secs)

format in ETWProcessMonlog.txt log file for version (1.0 , 1.1 and 2.0):

ETWProcessMonlog.txt and example of ETW VirtualMemAlloc event records:

     "[3/23/2022 5:07:51 PM] PID:(5140) TID(6628) :1661968515072:65536:MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE:0x10000:0x182f50c0000 [VirtualMemAlloc]"

in this VirtualMemAlloc Record in ETWProcessMonlog.txt you have these informations:
      
      [Date Time] PID:(????) TID(????) :Win32StartAddress:Size_of_Allocation:Mem_Commit, Mem_Reserve:Length:StartAddress]

so your ETW VirtualMemAlloc Event informations are :
       
      Date time => [3/23/2022 5:07:51 PM]
      PID => 5140
      TID => 6628
      Win32StartAddress => 1661968515072
      Size_of_Allocation => 65536
      Memory info => MEM_COMMIT, MEM_RESERVE
      Length:StartAddress => 0x10000:0x182f50c0000
      

### ETWProcessMon.exe v1.0/v1.1 for Beacon Detection via VirtualMemAlloc ETW Events....  
   ![](https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/blob/main/Pics/EventWatcher01.png)

when you change Delay execution (DelayExecution,SleepEx APIs) from 2 to 4 then in-memory you will have ETW VirtualMemAlloc Events every 4 Sec (Delta-time) for Notepad Process (Real-time)

### ETWProcessMon.exe v1.0/v1.1 for Beacon Detection via VirtualMemAlloc ETW Events....  
   ![](https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/blob/main/Pics/EventWatcher02.png)

in this simple example you can see how we can use ETWProcessMon2.exe v2.1 + ETWPM2Monitor2.exe v2.1 for Technique Detection & Payload Detection via ETW Events, in this case syscall technique Detected by ETW Events & ETWPM2Monitor2 v2.1

### ETWProcessMon2.exe v2.1 + ETWPM2Monitor2 v2.1 for Technique Detection via ETW Events....  
   ![](https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/blob/main/Pics/syscall.png)
   
Note: VirtualMemAlloc for (Payload-Detection) + ImageLoad & Remote-Thread-Injection Detection for (Technique-Detection) are useful for Blue Teams/Defenders, New Code "VirtualMemAllocMon.exe" created & in this code you can monitor all VirtualMemAlloc Events for ALL Process without using "ETWProcessMon2.exe" for more information => (https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/tree/main/VirtualMemAllocMon)

Note: in ETWProcessMon2 (v2.0) NewProcess events + Remote-Thread-Injection Detecetion events + TCPIP send events all will save in Windows Event Log which with EventViewer you can watch them also VirtualMemAlloc events + Remote-thread-injection Detection Events will save in text "ETWProcessMonlog.txt" log file too (at the same time). so in this version2 we have two type of Events log files => 1."windows event logs [ETWPM2]" , 2."ETWProcessMonlog.txt". 

Note: ETWProcessMon2.1 (v2.1) is new version of code, in this new version VirtualMemAlloc Events removed from source code that means now we don't have Text log file for VirtualMemAlloc Events & now Code Performance is very fast/good (this version ETWProcessMon2.1 will work with ETWPM2Monitor2 v2.1 very good for Technique/Payload Detection via ETW Events) but if you want VirtualMemAlloc Events by ETW you can use VirtualMemAllocMon.exe v1.1 C# Source code which is Memory scanner based on ETW VirtualMemAlloc events. 

Note: ETWProcessMon2.exe (v2.1) & ETWPM2Monitor2.exe (v2.1) published in "bin" directory. (8 Feb, 2022)


ETW Events in event log [ETWPM2]:

    [Information] Event ID 1  => NewProcess event

### VirtualMemAllocMon.exe v1.1 & VirtualMemAllocMon.exe v2.0

VirtualMemAllocMon is for Monitoring VirtualMemAlloc Event via ETW, when some Native APIs like "VirtualAllocEx" called by your code this event will happen via ETW. (Payload Detection by VirtualMemAlloc Events [in-memory] for All Processes).

"VirtualMemAllocMon" is simple tool for Monitor VirtualMemAlloc events in all Processes via ETW, with this code you can Monitor New VirtualMemAlloc Events for each Process, the goal is Payload Detection & my focus was on "Local Create Thread" & "Remote Thread Injection" + Meterpreter payload & Pe "MZ header" in-memory which made by Meterpreter x64 payload or Cobaltstrike x86 payload. this code will useful sometimes for Defenders & Blue Teamers but Pentesters/Red Teamers can use this too.

### SysPM2Monitor2.7.exe

this tool [SysPM2Monitor2 v2.7] is for Monitor Sysmon Event-Logs & this code almost is same with ETWPM2Monitor2.exe code but in this case this code Integrated with Sysmon Events so we dont have all ETW Events in this case, but we have ETW VirtualMemAllocMon code in this tool so we have at the same time Sysmon logs + ETW VirtualMemAlloc logs (memory scanner via ETW VirtualMemAlloc Events)...

link : https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/tree/main/SysPM2Monitor2.7

#### Note: `"sysmonconfig-export.xml" file was my rules for test sysmon so you should use these rules in this file for sysmon but only Event IDs 1,3,8,25 are important for this tool and you do not need other events IDs for running SysPM2Monitor2.7 so you can use your own rules with these Events IDs too.`

with this Application you can watch [Realtime ETW Events] with "EventIDs 1,2 & 3" which made by "ETWProcessMon2.exe"
    
    [Information] Event ID 1  => NewProcess event 
    [Warning]     Event ID 2  => Remote-Thread-Injection Detection event 
    [Information] Event ID 3  => TCPIP Send event
    
in this tool you can use Filters to watch realtime these events very simple (Filtering by EventIDs), also you save filtered events to text file.

### Build Project Note: If you have error for build Project name "ETWPM2Monitor", please read this page => [https://github.com/DamonMohammadbagher/ETWProcessMon2/tree/main/ETWPM2Monitor#readme] 

Note: with "ETWProcessMon2" you make ETW Events in Windows Event log so you can watch them by Windows EventViewer too but with this tool
you can see them like realtime (Result Refreshed by New Events), this will help you as Defender/Blue Teamer for RemoteThredInjection Detection + TCPIP traffic etc.

Note: after running "ETWPM2Monitor.exe", this code will show you all 3 EventIDs 1,2,3 without filters, but you can use Filter Menu to change this very simple.

Note: Filter [EventIDs 1,2] is good if you want to know which Process Created & which RemoteThreadInjection Detection you have after Payload execution etc...

Note: Filter [EventIDs 2,3] is good if you want to know, after which RemoteThreadInjection you will have TCPIP Network Traffic (Send Traffic). 

Note: this ETWPM2Monitor is [test version] & this code need to test more & more ;)
